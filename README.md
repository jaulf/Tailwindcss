# My first ever Tailwindcss / React project

This project was created using Tailwindcss and React

## `How did it go ?`

The project was really good, it really expanded my horizon. Initially I won't lie I was restricted my plain CSS because i had to re-create a lot of classes and ID's but with tailwindcss I could always test the codes in html before going to my index.css to create I think it's called utillites or was it state variants. My God, React's fast reloading is too superb.
